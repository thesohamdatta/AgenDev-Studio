**AutoDev Studio** is a clean, simple, and structured AI engineering assistant. It moves away from chaotic chatbots and provides a clear, step-by-step workflow to turn your ideas into working code.

## Philosophy: Simplicity over Noise

Most AI tools overwhelm you with text. AutoDev Studio acts like a calm Senior Engineer:
1.  **Understand** your goal.
2.  **Plan** the essentials.
3.  **Architect** a simple structure.
4.  **Build** the code.
5.  **Verify** it works.
6.  **Ship** it.

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the UI (Recommended)
This launches the visual "Studio" interface.
```bash
streamlit run src/ui/streamlit_app.py
```

### 2. Run CLI
For quick terminal-based generation.
```bash
python src/main.py "Build a markdown to HTML converter"
```
